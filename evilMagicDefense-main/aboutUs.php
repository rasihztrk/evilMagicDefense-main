            <p>We desire to bring many cultural elements under one roof to create something unique. That’s why
              we chose the name “Fusion Up”. As Fusion Up studio, we work together for projects with universal
              values and different perspectives to create a brand new IP.

            <p>Our team consists of gamers who can analyze various game models, talented artists with vision,
              entrepreneurs with experience in the gaming market and individuals with high potential to rise in this

              Google via Google Game Factory and Hi Games, and Anil Kabacan, the founder of Mak Management
              and CFO of Hungri games.

              spirit have achieved a first in Turkey and received government support with a mobile game project for

              branches and has academic infrastructure at the graduate and doctoral level in "Scriptwriting" and
              "Game Studies" in order to establish the foundation of our own IP and proveit on an international
              platform. <br> <br> We carefully address all the important issues at the root of a “successful game” and move
              forward with those who are capable of creating one.</p>
